# Crypto_Wallet_ETH


The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

1. Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application
2. Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction
3. Inspect the Transaction on Etherscan

Below is achomplished in this file: 
1. Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase (which you created earlier in the module).
2. Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.
3. Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.
4. Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Kovan testnet.
5. Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

## Technologies
This project leverages python 3.7.9 with the following packages:
Web3.py - A Python library for connecting to and performing operations on Ethereum-based blockchains
Infura API - An API that provides instant access to the Ethereum network
Streamlit - A platform to quickly share python code over the web
bip44 - bulding wallets from a seed phrase based on the BIP-44 standard
mnemonic - Generate a 12- or 24-word mnemonic seed phrase based on the BIP-39 standard


## Usage
To use the notebook:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run jupter lab git bash to see code
3. in git bash run the following command "streamlit run fintech_finder.py" to launch app
